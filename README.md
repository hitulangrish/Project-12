# InfantRegSys
Infant Program Online Registration and Evaluation System is a web application that we will be developing for IPAN that allows automated services for registration and administration of infant participants. The system will also let people to view recent program offerings, sign up to join those programs, and also get notifications associated to the future events. The system will also allow administrators to make new groups and new offerings; also share event information within existing program groups. Furthermore, as the system is highly responsive it can run on all platforms - mobile, tablets, computers etc. despite the size of the screen or the browser they use without any issues. The project has been accomplished using Angular JS on the front end and C# on the backend with javascript, jquery, bootstrap too. Furthermore, we plan to host in on a local server created by Xampp or WampServer. The coding will be done in Adobe Dream Weaver development environment. And the data will be stored in a SQL Server or Oracle.
